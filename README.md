# Forest Fire Size Classification Using Neural Network

## Overview:
This project aims to develop a neural network-based classification model to predict the size category of forest fires based on various environmental and weather factors. By utilizing features such as month, day, FFMC index, DMC index, DC index, ISI index, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, the model will classify forest fires into two categories: Small and Large.

## Objective:
To build an accurate classification model using neural networks to predict the size category of forest fires based on environmental and weather factors.

## Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables (month, day) using one-hot encoding.
2. Feature Normalization: Scale numerical features such as FFMC index, DMC index, DC index, ISI index, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall to a similar range to improve model convergence.
3. Splitting Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the neural network model.
4. Neural Network Architecture: Design a neural network architecture suitable for the classification task, including input, hidden, and output layers. Experiment with different architectures, activation functions, and regularization techniques to optimize model performance.
5. Model Training: Train the neural network model on the training dataset using techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing dataset using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the neural network model, including learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to improve performance.
8. Model Interpretation: Interpret the results of the trained model to understand the importance of different features in predicting forest fire size categories.

## Outcome:
The final outcome of this project will be a neural network-based classification model capable of accurately predicting the size category of forest fires based on environmental and weather factors.
